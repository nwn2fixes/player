Plate Mail 01 Fix by Drew Rechner
[version!]
http://www.nexusmods.com/neverwinter2/mods/1061/?
This fixes the matte material appearance for most male characters' Plate Mail
01 appearance and makes it appear much more similar to the female/other races'
version.

Skeleton Cloth Armor Tint Fix by rjshae
[version!]
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/images/texture/skeleton-cloth-armor-tint-fix
The file name was assigned to the tint map slot of the skeleton model but is
missing from the final release of the game. As a result, the unpatched skeleton
model does not tint properly and it shows the missing tint map error texture on
the model.

OC Doors Fix by crystal violet
[version!]
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/hakpak/original-hakpak/oc-doors-repair-override
These are replacements for some of the original door models and one normalmap.
I've tried to repair some minor texturing errors, odd shading issues and
logical errors (doors that have a window on one side but not on the other).

Imbue Item Indexing Bug Fix by Lord Grave
v.150122
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/imbue-item-indexing-bug-fix
This is most commonly known as "Power Essence Bug" when using Warlock's Imbue
Item feat to add basic enchantments to weapons and armor with Power Essences in
MotB crafting system. Although you put correct item and correct essences in the
satchel, when you use Imbue Item on it you get a message saying that it is not
a valid recipe.
NWN2 has a recipe index used to make searching for valid recipes faster and it
is located in crafting_index.2da file. Function GetRowIndexes() is used to
fetch a short list of valid recipes for the spell the player cast on the
crafting container. MotB developers used this function to fool the containers
into thinking that Imbue Item feat is the correct spell. Basically, their piece
of code for Imbue Item feat fetches all recipes that require spells by checking
if category column contains a numerical string with StringToInt() function,
which will return 0 if you try to convert a non-numerical string into an
integer. However, they forgot that this function will also return 0 for a '0'
string, and there is a group of recipes, starting at ID 40, that requires the
spell ID 0 (Acid Fog). The function will simply return a list of recipes
starting form the beginning and ending just before the recipes that require
Acid Fog spell, leaving slightly more than half of the list unusable for a
Warlock. Instead of rewriting their code, I just altered it slightly so that it
skips row 40 from the index file when checking whether StringToInt of the
category row returns 0.
NOTE: These scripts were implemented/compiled by kevL: I added a few scripts
that can be traced back to the changed function, although this might not be
strictly required.
NOTE: Lord Grave also fixed a mismatched prototype/definition for
GetIsItemPropertyAnUpgrade() in 'ginc_crafting'.

Greatclub description fix by Lance Botelle (implemented by kevL)
v.160912
Greatclubs were set to use a description that has 1d6 piercing damage and small
weapon size. The actual statistics are 1d10 bludgeoning damage and large weapon
size. So the baseitems.2da column "BaseItemStatRef" has been changed to reflect
something similar. The new description, however, says the Greatclub needs
proficiency with Martial weapons while the actual reference is to either
Martial or Rogue, and the Critical threat says 19-20 while the actual reference
is 20 (stock values were Martial and Rogue, and 19-20). To achieve maximal
conformity, the Dialog.Tlk file would need to be changed also (and that's
beyond the purview of this partial fix).

Script include fix (ginc_death) by kevL
v.171104
Fixes a mismatched prototype/definition for ShowProperDeathScreen().
Merged with the SoZ Campaign 'ginc_death' so it's suitable for /Override.
files:
- scripts\inc
ginc_death.NSS


GUI improvement by kevL
v.161008
The area for an intro-message in the default UI's stringinputmessagebox.xml has
so little vertical height that only one line is displayed at a time and the
up/down scroll-buttons almost completely overlap, making them difficult to use.
This improvement adds 50 pixels to the height for the intro-message.

stringinputmessagebox.xml


'x2_inc_restsys' fix by kevL's
v.161009
Fix mismatching prototype/definition for WMSetAreaTable().
files:
- scripts\inc
x2_inc_restsys.nss


Preference AI fix, by kevL
v.171118
In 'gai_preference_dcr', type ATTACK_PREFERENCE_TANK, an NPC-tank may try to
heal itself by calling TalentHealingSelf() from 'x0_i0_talent'. The return was
checked against a value of 99, but the function will return 0 or 1 only. The
condition has been changed to check against TRUE, to properly bypass regular
DCR when the NPC-tank performs a heal action on itself.
files:
- scripts
gai_preference_dcr.NSS


Tool Items model fixes by rjshae
v.180211
Here's a small contribution to "correct" the pan, rake, shovel, smithy hammer,

includes a modified baseitems.2da file, revised models, and an itemized list of
the changes. [See ToolItemsModelFixes.txt in the base directory.]

Ginc_Group #include fixes by Aqvilinus

Half-orc Female Cloth fix by rjshae

A texturing issue with the half-orc female cloth #10. The texture around the

Werewolf/Wererat weapon orientation fix by ArtEChoke
v.190604
This is a simple orientation fix for the attachment points on the Obsidian
Werewolf skeleton. This fix applies to the Ossian Wererat, as it shares the
same skeleton. Previously the werewolf held weapons at a bizarre angle that
clipped with its body and arms. This new skeleton will point the weapons in the
proper direction. What this fix does *NOT* do is add proper weapon grasping
animations, or proper weapon wielding animations. The creature will still
attack with one left claw swipe (or whatever weapon you put in its left hand)
and one bite.

TakeNumItems() fix by Shadooow (impl/ kevL)

Staff of Balpheron fix by Clangeddin
v.191226
The problem is the OnEquip tag-based item script, that script applies a bunch
of properties whenever it fires, the OnUnequip related script removes those
properties. Here's the problem though, when you load the game, the OnEquip
script fires, but the OnUnequip one does not, so if you equip, save, load,
save, load, save, load, save, etc you will keep on stacking those properties
until you get a staff with more than 255 item properties, which causes the
engine to not load the character properly when the game is loaded; in fact, all
other items are not displayed either in the inventory. What I did with the fix
was simply add a local var check that would not apply the properties again if
the item was already equipped, then I added the delete local var to the
OnUnequip script to make sure it works properly later. [bug report by Myskully]

Changes to spell scripts involving 100% immunity by Clangeddin
v.200103
The following spells had their 100% damage immunity changed to 9999 damage
resistance, this is done to prevent the damage immunity overflow bug that turns
them into vulnerabilities once they go past 100%. This operates under the same
principle of the energy immunity spells (level 6 cleric, druid, bard spell and
level 7 for Wiz/Sorc). The affected spells are:
1. Shadow Shield
2. Death Ward
3. Mass Death Ward
4. Iron Body (electric immunity only)
5. Stone Body (same as above)

MotB rest problems fix (reverts some of Nwn2Fixes OverlandMap
ApplyDialogSkillEffect() fix)
v.200331
The underlying bug is that, in SoZ on the overlandmap, the player can choose a
dialog option to Intimidate an encounter before going into battle but
EffectShaken() and EffectOffGuard() use negative values when constructing the
effects. Positive values should be used in 'ginc_overland' instead (the
constructors for the effects will subtract the positive values).

Tracing those functions back through several layers, they could be called by
'gui_rest'. HOWEVER the only place i *know* of them being used is on the SoZ
OL. And those are handled by just two scripts: 'ga_initiate_encounter' and
'ga_mated_encounter'.

So basically i'm going to delete 'gui_rest.NSS/.NCS' and
'k_mod_player_rest.NSS/.NCS' and 'ginc_restsys.NSS'. But keep 'ginc_overland'
because it has the core fix, as well as 'ga_initiate_encounter' and
'ga_mated_encounter' because they (definitely) use it. Note that
'x2_inc_restsys' fixes a prototype/definition mismatch for WMSetAreaTable() so
it should stay (unless it's still an issue).

Additionally, it's nice to get the module-level script 'k_mod_player_rest' out
of the Fixes package.

Shadow Simulacrum/Glass Doppelganger scrolls fix by kevL

Adds the Shadow Simulacrum and Glass Doppelganger spellscrolls and enables the
ScribeScroll feat to work with the Shadow Simulacrum and Glass Doppelganger

added to the icons table. No scroll icon was found for Glass Doppelganger so
the Shadow Simulacrum icon gets reused for it.

Chandelier fix by RjShae
v.210411
This set of files provides fixes for the stock PLC_MC_CHANDL01 and
PLC_MC_CHANDL02 chandelier models. For both chandeliers it increases the swing
amplitude to half a degree, so it is still subtle but at least visible to the
player's eye. For the second chandelier it corrects the height setting so that
the top of the chain lines up with the static component.

fx_drip fix by RjShae
v.211210
When you place the fx_drip effect in an area, sometimes the drops appear to go
up rather than down. The reason this happens is that the VelocityVariance
parameter in the 'fx_drip_fx1.pfx' effect file (under NWN2_VFX_X1/FX_Ambient) is
set to '6'. This is much larger than the z-direction velocity of '-2'. If you
set the VelocityVariance to '1', then the drips generally go in the correct
direction.

Gnome female cloth armor fix (1) by RjShae
v.211216
The Gnome female cloth armor in slot 8 is missing the tint map in the material
properties, so it can't be tinted in the toolset. (This is the body-length brown
robe.) Since it shares the same texture files as the human female, I added the
same human female tint map file to the model.

splitgold.XML enhancement by Lance_Botelle
v.211219
Multi-player barter subscreen. When you first open it, the input window is not
the focus, so you have to click in its text window to be able to start typing.
Secondly, there is either a figure "0" (zero) by default, or the last gold
figure you had entered and used every time it is opened. So you have to click in
the text box, delete the figures in the text box, and then click on the OK
button. Very cumbersome. Two required steps even before you can use it!

By contrast, this box has immediate text entry focus, does not have any
redundant text in it (that would require deletion) and is ready for immediate
input and 'enter' for those who prefer efficiency of input. (Or escape to
cancel.) It makes gold splitting (on a MP barter) much more intuitive.

- better initial focus
- maintains focus
- forgets previous input on reuse
- allows escape to cancel and return key to accept

The Gnome female cloth armor in slot 7 is missing the tint map in the material

More LoD fixes by RjShae
v.220627
This is a performance improvement patch that adds (missing) level-of-detail
(LoD) meshes to stock creatures that have a higher number of faces. It includes
the blue dragon, clockroach, gnoll #2, hag #2, imaskari golem, jinn, panther,
ravenous incarnation, siege tower, snow leopard, giant spider, treant, and
troll.

Note that the troll models did include some LoD3 and LoD6 parts, but a
recently-discovered bug may have prevented the game engine from properly
triggering the LoD at range. The full range of L01-L06 has now been added to the
Troll models.

TurnUndead Mapped Feats fix by TonyK

Sacred Purification feat icon doesn't show the Turn Undead uses left in game.
Fix by adding 294 (Turn Undead feat id) into the UsesMapFeat column of row 2255

has this bug additionally for Divine Vengeance.

Wizard/Sorcerer default School Specializations fixes by rjshae
v.230331
The following are specialist Wizard spell package files that are assigned by
packages.2da. They are used in cases of auto-leveling with the LevelUpHenchman()
call. They can also be called by the 'Set to Package Default' button under the
character blueprint Spells tab.

In each case, the list contains some spells from the opposition school and is
missing a few spells from the specialist school. Where possible, I replaced
selected opposition spells with the missing specialist spells, or else with a
non-opposition spell. I moved the modified specialist spell rows up the spell
level list so the character is more likely to gain the spell on level up.

See 'wizard.txt' in the 2da folder for exact changes.

GetDurationType() fix by travus
v.230611
The string-parameter passed (I, T, or P) was not being converted to a
duration-type correctly. FindSubString() returns the position of the letter,
which one expects to be 0 (the first letter). However, 0 evaluated to FALSE
instead of TRUE, so the correct return was bypassed and the default
duration-type got returned. Additionally, if FindSubString() doesn't find the
letter, it returns -1, which evaluates to TRUE instead of FALSE, which caused a
duration-type other than the default to return. The fix is to compare the first
letter of the string-parameter to the allowed types (I, T, or P).

Golem Fighting Bugfix by Vandervecken
v.160820
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/prefab/item/golem-fighting-bugfix-red-wizard-academy-motb
At the Academy of Shapers and Binders in Act II of Mask of the Betrayer, you
can participate in a Golem fighting ring. You can construct you Golem out of a
number of different Golem pieces you have acquired during your travels. Part of
the purpose of this minigame is to construct and disassemble your Golem until
you hit upon winning combinations against the various combinations your golem
faces. Unfortunately, if you install the Galvanized Golem Torso or the
Weather-resistant Golem Torso, disassembling your Golem will return you only a
generic Golem Torso. Those advanced torso pieces are gone for good. You don't
even get their benefits on the golem.
The cause of this is some mis-set variables on the objects themselves.

Black Garius + nightwalker fix by kevL
v.161003
At the defense of Crossroad Keep, when Black Garius is about to summon his
nightwalker, he gets distracted and often doesn't complete his dialog
successfully due to all the fighting going on in the courtyard. If the
nightwalker does not summon, the plot breaks because it needs to be defeated
for the plot to continue. This fix temporarily removes several of Black Garius'
AI scripts related to combat, so that he does not react to being hit by arrows
and so is no longer tempted to retaliate against the greycloaks that surround
the barricade. This allows his dialog to complete and the nightwalker to be
summoned correctly. His AI then returns to normal and the Battle of Crossroad
Keep commences.

Get Soldiers Dead fix by kevL
v.171117
In Module 2000_Neverwinter, dialog '20_deorwin', Deorwin gives one response if
he's the only soldier left alive and a different one if he's not. Bug: The
script that checks this condition returns FALSE only if no soldiers died (which
is redundant since Doerwin is a soldier and the PC is talking to him); so, the
condition is always TRUE, causing Doeorwin to state that he has to bury "four
sons" - instead of falling through to the next dialog-node, in which he gives
the PC thanks for bringing "us" through. This fix modifies the script to check
that all other four soldiers have died in the battle with Qaggoth, while
protecting Cyran, and indeed Deorwin is the only soldier left alive.

Hlam dialog fixes by NinjaSpectre
v.180426
When telling Khelgar to be a monk, the order on the check was wrong so you
could never succeed (although not really a big problem since that is what he
chooses if you let him decide). The next one is when you leave the conversation
before making the final choice. The entry back into this decision didn't check
if Khelgar was with you or if he had already made the choice. I moved this into
the same area as the check for each of the trials, and put condition checks on
it to make sure all 3 have been completed before being available. The last
thing I did is set the flag for Khelgar being a monk even though you tell him
to stay a warrior. This is because the Journal states that the quest is
finished and I didn't notice any other variable being set for this outcome.
[kL_note: That might make for some weirdness if subsequent scripts/dialogs
think Khelgar actually is monk.] Without this change Khelgar could still become
a monk afterwards trough the dialog, but the Journal would not be updated from
before.

Modified the fix by NinjaSpectre, but change nkhelgarismonk=1 to

Georg and Tarmas fix by kevL
v.190416
Fixes stuff in the opening battle in West Harbor after the tutorial finishes.
11_a_georg_lv.NSS - better redundancy check that ensures Georg gets to the
gathering point before the wheatfield battle; refactored and optimized because
it's just too difficult/frustrating to figure out what's going on otherwise.
11_cs_tarmas.NSS - move Tarmas to a gather-point instead of directly to the
wheatfield; do not assign Tarmas a custom heartbeat script (ForceRest) since it
just gets in the way of his actions/combat/behaviors.
11_dcr_tarmaswheat.NSS - get the nearest hostile creature to a friendly who is
below half health for Tarmas to target. ie, Rewrite script.
11_wound_heal.NSS - don't AssignCommand to OBJECT_SELF; check the entire PC
party for moss, not just the true PCs; don't make recruits wait so long before
moving to destination; refactored and optimized overall.
1100_client_en.NSS - destroy pre-placed Tarmas and spawn Tarmas w/ spells; this
instantiates the 'tarmasbattle.UTC' file.
tarmasbattle.UTC - this is not a copy of the stock 'tarmasbattle.UTC' but a
copy of the pre-placed Tarmas as he appears in West Harbor. It is identical to
the pre-placed Tarmas except it has Ray of Frost (x4), Magic Missile (x4),
Melf's Acid Arrow (x4), Flame Arrow (x3), and uses the standard heartbeat
script instead of the ForceRest script.

Many Starred Cloaks fix (Vale, Sevann, Nathe) by kevL
v.200118
flag Vale,Sevann,Nathe as immortal and Vale as plot for the Crossroad Keep
basement battle with BlackGarius. The problem is that if Vale dies the game
breaks since his dialog is required to exit the basement. When the PC first
meets the MSC they are spawned from blueprints that have the flags set
properly; but a change was made to preplace them in the basement before the
battle, but those flags were not set. This fix changes the flags of the
preplaced instances to match those of the blueprints, in the OnEnter script of
the Crossroad Keep basement. (Note: I left Vale as non-plot but immortal, since
there is code in the AI that can prevent plot-characters from becoming engaged
in combat.)

Consolidate 2330_cli_enter.NSS by kevL
v.200220
The OnClientEnter (area) script '2330_cli_enter' exists in two versions: one
for 2300_Crossroad_Keep_Adv (module) and another for 2000_Neverwinter (module).
They are different but the same filename is slotted for specific areas'
OnClientEnter events of both modules. This creates a conflict when a script of
that filename is in the Override folder; the engine is going to use the script
in Override regardless of which area is entered. So this tweak merges the two
stock scripts of both areas together into one script, separated into two
distinct codeblocks that are conditioned according to whether or not Torio is
present. Both are the basement areas of Crossroad Keep - 2330_ck_base (area in
2300_Crossroad_Keep_Adv) is used for the Torio cutscene after the Trial By
Combat, and 2330_ck_base (area in 2000_Neverwinter) is used for the battle
against Black Garius with the Many Starred Cloaks. The merged script shall be
kept in the 2300_Crossroad_Keep_Adv folder, however, since that's where the
prefix of its filename implies it should be.

Silver Sword reforged fixes by kevL
v.220329
In the cutscene that plays when reforging the Silver Sword in West Harbor, the
dialog's script could force PC to drop an item but the routine that checks for a
full inventory was incorrect. The fix is to take the routine out and let the
PC's hand-items drop to the ground if his/her inventory really is full. Further,
better handling for creating and equipping the reforged Silver Sword has been
implemented - there should be slight chance of it falling to the ground now,
space will be made in the PC's inventory if need be. Also fixed the party
staring in random directions by moving the action script to StandGround before
the script that jumps the party to its cutscene-location. Also corrected an
assignment operator (=) that should be an equivalency check (==).
v.220506
Many changes including a general rewrite of the cutscene script and adapting the
dialog file to reflect those changes.
- changed the dialog owner from the PC to Zhjaeve. This simplifies many of the
character-facing problems in the cutscene.
- assigned appropriate names to the camera-trackers since they are assigned as
the speakers of several dialog nodes.
- kPrC Pack compatibility with BaseItems.2da: the camera-trackers didn't have
Weapon Proficiency to equip their invisible gloves; this grants them Weapon
Proficiency (Simple) and re-equips their gloves if necessary.
- created a modified OnEnter script for the cutscene-trigger which turns off the
party's OrientOnDialog flags. The flags are re-enabled in a dialog end/abort
script.
- wrote a better routine that destroys all shards in the Module and any that
have been stashed on characters in the roster. This routine also destroys any
'rogue' shards that are being incorrectly stored by the Module.

Tor's Holy Symbol pick-up fix by kevL

is in a chest. If the former is killed and/or if the chest is bashed open the
symbol drops into a bodybag and Obsidian's routine to find and destroy the
symbol that is not acquired breaks. So iterate over all symbols in the module
and destroy the one that wasn't just acquired.
Also use IsItemMarkedAsDone() and MarkItemAsDone() to prevent the OnItemAcquired
script from firing in other modules in case player elects to not turn in the
Holy Symbol.
Also use IsItemAcquiredByPartyMember() for multiplayer compatibility.

RemoveJournalQuestEntry() fix by travus
v.230724
The '11_a_tarmas_center' script (1100_West_Harbor module) still has a loophole
that doesn't remove the quest from the entire party (at this point you will have
a companion in the party). It only removes the quest from the currently
controlled character. The issue is with the RemoveJournalQuestEntry() function -
specifically, with the 'bAllPartyMembers' and 'bAllPlayers' parameters both
being set to TRUE. See the comment in the corrected script below. This script
was already in the nwn2fixes - I just added additional code to fix the issue.
Additionally, the RemoveJournalQuestEntry() function with both mentioned
parameters set to TRUE is used in the '3031_ds_tholapsyx' and '3033_ds_fgking'
scripts (both in the 3000_Neverwinter_A3 module). I haven't looked closely at
those but I'm assuming the issue will occur there as well.
It's also used in the tutorial but, from what I can tell, there is already
scripting employed there to clear the journal entries from the entire party.

"[Success] Well ... here. You can have what I've got left from my militia pay.
Things are probably more expensive out there." There is a failure node, but this

"|Devout or Cleric|Yes - yes, there is. Over the years we've talked many times

devout or cleric, but only devout is checked. Added an 'OR gc_check_class(2)'.

OC dialog fixes by travus
v.230811
OC module 1000_Neverwinter_A1 dialog buggery:

10_4cs_wolf2.DLG
- Intimidate check missing at this node: "[Success] {Unsettled}You walk this
time, Wolf... This time...". Recommend gc_skill_rank(11, 1) to keep similar to
the diplomacy check in the node above it. Additionally, the same node does not
have a failure branch. Recommend adding a link to the failure branch in the
diplomacy check node above it.

10_caleb.DLG
- Almost all skill checks were using a non-existent check script
(gc_check_skill). Recommend changing all to the equivalent gc_skill_rank.
- Intimidate nodes had a "success" link to diplomacy check nodes. Recommend
copy/paste text from the diplomacy success nodes above them to create a new node
for the intimidate check branches. Then add a respective gc_skill_rank script to
those new nodes. Finally, link back to the diplomacy branch from there.
- A successful Bluff check did not award XP at this node: "[Success] Now hold on
a moment. I do know some people - important people. I can't just show you the
way to them though. They don't like strangers". Recommend adding
ga_give_xp(50,1) to keep in-line with prior skill successes.
- Accepting a bribe from Caleb when successfully using the intimidate branch
gave you gold twice. Recommend removing the ga_give_gold script from the "I'll
be on my way, then" node as the gold is already given (200 or 100gp) prior to
this point.
- Set some of the skill check nodes to "once per game" to prevent them from
showing again after a failure. Otherwise it is possible to keep selecting the
same nodes over and over until success.
- Added ga_camera_facing_point_party and ga_face_target scripts to the CONTINUE
node just after this node: "That you did. Here's your share, and there's more to
come. Plenty of merchants around here that aren't under our 'protection' yet".
This was done to change the camera to view Hagen and the guards when they
arrive. Otherwise it is not clear to the player who is the one talking if the
camera is facing the other direction as they arrive behind the player.

10_cs_qara_intro.DLG
- Skill check missing at this node: "[Diplomacy] I'm sure there's another way we
can work this out without me and my friends becoming involved". Recommend
gc_skill_rank(6,4).
- Skill check missing at this node: "|Intimidate|[Intimidate] If a single spell
is cast, I will kill you all without a second thought". Recommend
gc_skill_rank(11,4).
- All nodes commented with alignment shifts had no ga_alignment scripts.

10_guardatk.DLG
- Diplomacy check missing at this node: "[Success] You're right. Taking this
'gift' makes me just as bad as the other turncoats". Recommend
gc_skill_rank(6,6).

10_guardnp.DLG
- All skill checks had no check scripts. I count 5 total between Diplomacy and
Intimidate. Recommend all rank 6 checks.

10_guardnp2.DLG
- All skill checks had no check scripts. I count 4 total between Diplomacy and
Intimidate. Recommend all rank 6 checks.

10_hagen.DLG
- All skill checks had no check scripts. I count 8 total between Diplomacy,
Intimidate and Appraise. Recommend all rank 6 checks.

10_lockpicker.DLG
- All skill checks had no check scripts. I count 4 total between Diplomacy and
Intimidate. Recommend all rank 6 checks.

10_mugger - Diplomacy skill check was using a non-existent check script
(gc_check_skill). Recommend changing to the equivalent gc_skill_rank.

Moire fix by travus
v.230813
Evil path - At a point, Moire will leave her place in the docks to meet you at
Axle's place in the merchant district. But once you get to Axle's place, Moire
is nowhere to be found. This is because Moire has an OnSpawn script and
X2_L_SPAWN_USE_STEALTH variable that sets her to stealth mode. She has a high
hide/move silent skill, so unless you have a high spot/listen, you'll never see
her in Axle's place, therefore breaking the game. The fix is to destealth Moire
in the OnClientEnter script for Axle's area. [impl. kevL]

Ring of Caitlyn fix by travus
v.230813
In the Tomb of the Betrayers area ({1019}tombs)(1700_Merchant_Quarter.mod) there
is a chest in the NW chamber which contains the unique Ring of Caitlyn. This
ring has two properties:
	AC Bonus +2 (deflection)
	Armor Bonus vs undead +1 (deflection)

Deflection bonuses do not stack, so this ring will only ever provide a +2 bonus
no matter if fighting undead or not as the best deflection bonus will be used.
I'm assuming the intent was to stack the bonuses for a total +3 AC bonus when
fighting undead.

The easiest way to fix this is to run an ItemAcquired script that changes the
Armor Bonus vs undead to +3. [impl. kevL]

On a side note, the only blueprint for this item (10caitring) is located in the
1000_Neverwinter_A1 mod.

Teamwork Training fixes by kevL's

The script (m_c_tw_rush) that checks prerequisites for Team Rush should require
that the pc-speaker has *both* the Toughness feat AND Survival skill 8+. The
script (m_c_tw_cob) that checks prerequisites for Circle of Blades should
require that the pc-speaker has *both* BAB 6+ AND Weapon Specialization (any
melee). The script (m_c_tw_foe) that checks prerequisites for Foe Hunting
should require that other party-members have *both* BAB 4+ AND Survival skill
1+; also allow Favored Enemy Plant to satisfy pc-speaker prerequisite. The
script (m_c_teamwork) that checks if Circle of Blades has already been trained
also mistakenly checked that Superior Flank had not been trained yet (note:
this script may clash with an alternate method using global_ints that also get
used to check if a particular Teamwork feat has been trained - usage seems
arbitrary). Daerred's dialog (m11_daerred) was missing several navigation nodes
(these were fixed by someone else and I only include the file here). Candril's
dialog (m11_candril) referenced a non-existent script (m_c_trance_prereq) and

join the battle (not terribly difficult). On the loremaster's body you will
find a certain scroll which you can show to the captain outside. The villagers
won't be terribly thankful, though... As far as the pig is concerned, just
speak to it.

Port Llast Undead Army Fix (SoZ)
v.190216
This is a simple fix for (some) of the problems with the Port Llast quests that
have to do with Septimund, Nya, and Lord Adreum. I [Joshauwa] have only fixed
errors where it is obvious what the developers have meant to do, so I have not
assumed that the developers meant to allow you to lead the undead army into
Port Llast AND keep Septimund, since there is no evidence in the scripting that
this was an original plan. Also, while it is feasible that there was supposed
to be an option to put Adreum to rest without leading the army or killing him,
I found no evidence for it and so did not create it. It also seems reasonable
that the developers originally meant Adreum to only show up when Nya mentioned
him, but there's also no real evidence in the scripting for that, so I didn't
change it. Finally, I didn't bother fixing the sloppy coding that doesn't
actually affect gameplay: the music doesn't change back in the graveyard after
the undead army leaves, for example. If anyone feels inclined to changed these
things, they are welcome to use the files in my fix as a starting point (you
shouldn't need any other files, except that you will have to create scripts and
journal entries that don't yet exist).

Overland Map PartyLeader fix by Akhacha - modified by kevL
v.230915
When PC enters an overland map and the 'oPartyLeader' variable has not been set
on the module-object, changing the leader can cause an awkward jump to the new
party leader. Fix is to ensure that the 'oPartyLeader' variable gets set to
GetFactionLeader(GetFirstPC()) in the OnEnter script for overland map areas.
