Skeleton Cloth Armor Tint Fix by rjshae
[version!]
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/images/texture/skeleton-cloth-armor-tint-fix
The file name was assigned to the tint map slot of the skeleton model but is missing from the final release of the game. As a result, the unpatched skeleton model does not tint properly and it shows the missing tint map error texture on the model.

OC Doors Fix by crystal violet
[version!]
http://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/hakpak/original-hakpak/oc-doors-repair-override
These are replacements for some of the original door models and one normalmap. I've tried to repair some minor texturing errors, odd shading issues and logical errors (doors that have a window on one side but not on the other).

Imbue Item Indexing Bug Fix by Lord Grave
v.150122
https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn2/script/imbue-item-indexing-bug-fix
This is most commonly known as "Power Essence Bug" when using Warlock's Imbue Item feat to add basic enchantments to weapons and armor with Power Essences in MotB crafting system. Although you put correct item and correct essences in the satchel, when you use Imbue Item on it you get a message saying that it is not a valid recipe.
NWN2 has a recipe index used to make searching for valid recipes faster and it is located in crafting_index.2da file. Function GetRowIndexes() is used to fetch a short list of valid recipes for the spell the player cast on the crafting container. MotB developers used this function to fool the containers into thinking that Imbue Item feat is the correct spell. Basically, their piece of code for Imbue Item feat fetches all recipes that require spells by checking if category column contains a numerical string with StringToInt() function, which will return 0 if you try to convert a non-numerical string into an integer. However, they forgot that this function will also return 0 for a '0' string, and there is a group of recipes, starting at ID 40, that requires the spell ID 0 (Acid Fog). The function will simply return a list of recipes starting form the beginning and ending just before the recipes that require Acid Fog spell, leaving slightly more than half of the list unusable for a Warlock. Instead of rewriting their code, I just altered it slightly so that it skips row 40 from the index file when checking whether StringToInt of the category row returns 0.
NOTE: These scripts were implemented/compiled by kevL: I added a few scripts that can be traced back to the changed function, although this might not be strictly required.
NOTE: Lord Grave also fixed a mismatched prototype/definition for GetIsItemPropertyAnUpgrade() in 'ginc_crafting'.
